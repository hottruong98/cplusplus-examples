Abstraction is one of the feature of Object Oriented Programming, where you show only relevant details to the user and hide irrelevant details. For example, when you send an email to someone you just click send and you get the success message, what actually happens when you click send, how data is transmitted over network to the recipient is hidden from you (because it is irrelevant to you).
