Encapsulation is a process of combining data members and functions in a single unit called class. This is to prevent the access to the data directly, the access to them is provided through the functions of the class. It is one of the popular feature of Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) that helps in data hiding.
### How Encapsulation is achieved in a class:
1) Make all the data members private.
2) Create public setter and getter functions for each data member in such a way that the set function set the value of data member and get function get the value of data member.
